# CloudMap
CloudMap is a python project for EE5. It converts GeoTIFF files into images where a route (based on an Excel file) and 
the current location is plotted on.

## Test
To test the code you can use the _environment.yml_ file to create the python environment with Anaconda. Don't forget to 
run the script as follows:
`python geotiff_to_map.py [GeoTIFF_file] [Excel_file]`
Where the GeoTIFF file can be _test.tif_ and the Excel file can be _latlon.xlsx_.
